        :markdown
          Freiminuten (literally *free minutes*) is a bonus program connected
          to the TradeDoubler and Affili.net networks, earning revenue by
          referring users to partner stores, and earning a small commission.

          This commission is then given to their users as mobile phone credit.
          Freiminuten also provides back-end services to mobile network operators
          for crediting accounts via real-time APIs.

        :markdown
          Watched.it plugs into many common media players to automatically scrobble
          (*track*, or *record*) which episodes, of which shows are watched, and sends
          intelligent notifications about follow-ups, or othere interesting content.

          The data is used to provide series-links and notifications for new content
          related to the user's interests and favourite shows.

      [Wacku] is my software development agency. I built a network of great
      people and we've staffed and supported many many projects big and small.

      We're a collective that has changed configuration and size over the last
      4 years, but we've always been a group of at least three, sometimes
      growing as large as 7 to staff longer, more challenging projects.

    :markdown
      Speach Media's main project is Freiminuten.de; Acting as CTO, I ensure
      that we make the correct technical decisions, and keep the platform
      moving in the right direction.  I am also their only developer. (*that
      part isn't so great!*)

      I took over the project after the initial 8 week inception phase, after
      12 months of feature development and paying-back of *technical debt* we
      were able to focus on a variety of improvements to the backend APIs which
      enable the platform to be autonomous, and run with almost no human
      interaction.

      The stack is Ruby on Rails, Resque, Elastic Search, Sinatra, [Middleman],
      SASS and HAML.  Running on top of a Chef managed [Linode] cluster running
      Ubuntu.

    Watched.it Limited

    :markdown
      I founded [Watched.it] in 2009 and have been working slowly but steadily on it since then.

      Acting as founder, developer, product owner, accountant, marketeer, customer, debugger,
      QA and designer has been tougher than I ever imagined it would be.

      [Watched.it] works a lot like [last.fm], [scrobbling] the TV Shows that people watch on
      their computers, or allowing them to manually scrobble using the web application, or via
      their smartphone.

      [Watched.it] provides an at-a-glance overview of which content is available, and which
      contend has already been watched, allowing people to forget about ever-changing TV
      schedules, release delays, mid-season breaks, and more.

      The side-effect of providing a useful service to TV fans, is a a valuable insight into
      realtime viewing patterns across all mediums, especially those often overlooked by cable
      rating companies.

      The stack is Ruby on Rails, Sinatra, Resque, [C], [ZeroMQ], [Backbone.js]. Running in
      a [Linode] supported by [CloudFront] managed with Chef and Capistrano.

      **Watched.it is actively seeking investment, mentors and assistance to make my dream
      become a reality, if you are interested in working with me, investing and believing in me,
      and helping to make my project enter the mainstream, please [contact me].**
